# TODO:

- Fetch “Where to Stream” for To Watch media
- Tag System (Christmas, Halloween, etc.)
  - Maybe use a special key (i.e. genre) that when marked as that key they don’t show up in the list of all items but show in a list for that specific item
  - Tag for a specific season (or store multiple dates for the multiple seasons if it’s a series)
- Table View
- Authentication
